Introduction 

We have reviewed the accompanying financial information of Electra Multifamily Investments Fund II, L.P. 
("the Partnership"), which comprises the condensed consolidated statements of financial position as of 
September 30, 2024 and the related condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive 
income for the nine and three months periods ended September 30, 2024, and changes in members' capital 
and cash flows for the nine months periods ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes. The Partnership's 
board of directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of interim financial 
information for these periods in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information based on our review. 

Scope of review 

We conducted our review in accordance with Review Standard 2410 of the Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants in Israel, "Review of interim Financial Information Performed by the independent Auditor of the 
Entity". A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Israel and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

Conclusion 

Based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim 
financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles, which differ in certain respects from the IFRS, as describe in Note 8, to the consolidated 
financial statements.

                         eliminated, and the real estate properties are presented according to their fair value. 
                         In addition, closing costs capitalized and included in the assets carrying value under

                         Fair value. In addition, closing costs in association with acquiring the asset are 
                         expensed under IFRS and therefore eliminated from the carrying value of the asset. 
                         Thus, the investment in unconsolidated entities and the Partnership's share of profits 
                         of entities accounted for at equity are adjusted to reflect the elimination of 
                         depreciation and the addition of closing costs and valuations.

                                ALEMIF III REIT HOLDINGS, L.P. 

Introduction 

We have reviewed the accompanying financial information of ALEMIF III REIT Holdings, L.P. ("the 
Partnership"), which comprises the condensed consolidated statements of financial position as of 
September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income for 
the nine and three months periods ended September 30, 2024, and changes in members' capital and cash flows 
for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes. The Partnerships' board of 
directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of interim financial information 
for these periods in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on this interim financial information based on our review. 

Scope of review 

We conducted our review in accordance with Review Standard 2410 of the Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants in Israel, "Review of interim Financial Information Performed by the independent Auditor of the 
Entity". A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Israel and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

Conclusion 

Based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim 
financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles, which differ in certain respects from the IFRS, as describe in Note 6, to the consolidated 
financial statements.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 6 :- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND IFRS (Cont.) 

                  (1)   Real estate, net - the investment properties are presented according to their fair value. 
                        Thus, for the conversion from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, those depreciation expenses are 
                        eliminated, and the real estate properties are presented according to their fair value. 
                        In addition, closing costs capitalized and included in the assets carrying value under 
                        US GAAP are expensed in accordance with IFRS. 

                  (2)   Investment in unconsolidated entities - the depreciation expenses of the real estate 
                        assets are eliminated, and the real estate properties are presented according to their 
                        Fair value. In addition, closing costs in association with acquiring the asset are 
                        expensed under IFRS and therefore eliminated from the carrying value of the asset. 
                        Thus, the investment in unconsolidated entities and the Partnership's share of profits 
                        of entities accounted for at equity are adjusted to reflect the elimination of 
                        depreciation and the addition of closing costs.
